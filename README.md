<h1>Coinverse</h1>
</div>

A website developed with Next.js and integrates the Ethereum Rinkeby test network.

## Description

This website uses a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The user can interact with this smart contract to swap Ethereum for website coins. These coins can be spent and earned while playing the games avaliable.

## How To Use

- The website can be accessed from: https://coinverse-app.vercel.app/

- To be able to swap your Ethereum you need to use the MetaMask browser extension
  - Make sure your Ethereum is on the Rinkeby Test Network

- The games are playable without MetaMask, however to withdraw or purchase more coins you will require the extension.

## Road Map

This is the first version of my project and I plan on adding and improving features in the future. Some improvements include:

- Improving the design of the website
- Improving the data storage method
- Adding more games
